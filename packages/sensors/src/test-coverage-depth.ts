/**
 * Inventory sensor: test coverage depth (F3 × T2). Phase 26.F
 * (closes D-77 sub-batch 26.F). Translates a normalized coverage
 * summary into a PASS/REVIEW/FAIL verdict using configurable
 * thresholds. Wraps the existing `normalizeCoverage` helper in
 * the dissolved predecessor core package (the CLI verb at `commands/sense/test-coverage-depth.ts`
 * does the loading; the sensor itself is pure with respect to the
 * summary input, mirroring 26.C's pattern).
 *
 * Status semantics (defaults):
 *   - PASS: lines_pct ≥ 80.
 *   - REVIEW: 50 ≤ lines_pct < 80.
 *   - FAIL: lines_pct < 50.
 *   - UNKNOWN-ish: coverage report missing → status='review' with a
 *     finding code, so adopters see "coverage not collected" rather
 *     than a falsely-passing zero.
 *
 * Adopters override thresholds via the pack-config key
 * `extractor_params.test_coverage.thresholds: {pass:80, review:50}`
 * (CLI passes through; the sensor stays pure).
