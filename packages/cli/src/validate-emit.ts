/**
 * Validate a contract instance against its JSON Schema before emitting.
 *
 * Every CLI command that emits a JSON instance of a contract type
 * (Task, Scorecard, Triage, PromptComposition, SensorReading, …) must
 * call one of these helpers on the emit path. Schema drift is a hard-gate
 * failure (CLAUDE.md §"Schema instances validate against schemas").
 *
 * Two modes:
 *
 *   - `validateOrExit`: hard-fail. Exits with EXIT_CONFIG (65) on
 *     validation failure. Use for emit paths whose runtime shape is
 *     known to conform.
 *
 *   - `validateOrWarn`: soft-fail. Writes a warning to stderr and
 *     continues. Use as a transitional gate while the runtime payload
 *     is being reshaped to conform; drift is visible without breaking
 *     production. Returns `true` when the payload validates.
