# DEVAI

DEVAI is a human-supervised control harness for AI-assisted software development.
It measures a declared repository, runs bounded operations, and records evidence
without taking release authority away from its maintainers.

## Current product surface

The release candidate ships one publishable package, `@devai-nyx/cli`, with 41
catalogued actions, 59 sensors, and 7 recipes. Seven public workflow domains cover
adoption, diagnosis, validation, observation, work execution, evidence, and release
inspection. Internal `task` and `catalog` actions are visible with `devai --all`.

Start read-only:

```bash
devai init plan --target . --tier tier1 --format json
devai doctor --repo-root . --format json
devai catalog actions --format json
```

Apply only a reviewed plan, with the exact role and consent required by that action.
