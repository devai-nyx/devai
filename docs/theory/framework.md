# Framework

> §3 is the framework reference — the contract DEVAI offers to an adopter. Reading it tells you what you are getting and what is expected of you. The [Constitution](../reference/law.md) is the index; everything else here is commentary that orients you to the Constitution's binding text.
>
> §3 is deliberately separated from [§7 Meta](../dev), which describes DEVAI's *self-application* (DEVAI applied to its own development per [Article 36](../reference/law.md)). The split is binding per [ADR-DOCS-IA Decision 2](../../law/adr/README.md): an adopter reading "the framework requires X" should never have to disambiguate "X is a property of the framework you are adopting" from "X is what DEVAI happens to do in its own client-of-itself repo."

## What's here

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Constitution](../reference/law.md) | The ordered constitutional articles. The Index. Cite by article number. |
| [Substrates](./framework/substrates.md) | F1-F5 — Specification, Plant, Observation, Inventory, Harness — and how authority-by-path enforcement works. |
| [Transversals](./framework/transversals.md) | T1-T9 — Coverage, Depth, Coherence, Alignment, Idiomaticity, Security/Privacy, Performance/Efficiency, Robustness, Discipline — evaluated across substrates. |
| [Aspect grid](./framework/aspect-grid.md) (W10) | The 5×9 substrate × transversal grid with the sensor that scores each cell. |
| [Scorecard](./framework/scorecard.md) | Hard gate, soft gate, tri-state verdicts, threshold defaults, tie-breaker ladder. |
| [Loop](./framework/loop.md) | Triage → three cycles (A/B/C) → iteration cap → RGR → escalation. |
| [Concurrency](./framework/concurrency.md) | Coupled triplets, module locks, pipelined rebase, worktree discipline. |
| [Evidence](./framework/evidence.md) | Hash-chained per-event records; what's evidenced; verification and redaction. |
| [Invariants](./framework/invariants.md) | The atomic spec unit; trace; per-invariant change policy. |
| [Test policy](./framework/test-policy.md) (W09) | Six test suites, journeys, DB tests, mutation scenarios, weakening, quarantine, coverage, per-batch verification. |
| Contracts | API/data contracts under `docs/reference/contracts/`. |
| Schemas | The schema roster is derived from `law/policy/population-registry.json` and guarded by the schema liveness checks; no prose count is authoritative. |
| Glossary | Canonical vocabulary under `law/glossary/`; cite by term. |
| Product | Owner-authored journeys and use-cases under `product/`. |

## How to read this section

Pick by purpose:

- **First contact with the framework.** Read [Constitution](../reference/law.md) end-to-end (~30 min). The constitutional articles; each is short. The constitution is the binding contract; everything else derives.
- **You need to do something specific** (write an invariant, gate a merge, route a failure, declare a coupled triplet). Use the table above to jump.
- **You need to understand a sensor.** Start at the [Aspect grid](./framework/aspect-grid.md), find the cell, follow the link to the sensor's design note.
- **You need to argue about authority.** Articles 4-10 cover substrates, paths, roles, agent disciplines, the authority chain, and the within-iteration separation rule. Cite by article number when you make the argument.

## Adopter contract anchor

Every page in §3 describes a property of DEVAI that holds for *every* adopter that runs the framework. If a property is DEVAI-specific (e.g., "DEVAI's self-scorecard shows 35 PASS / 2 FAIL"), it lives in §7 Meta, not here.
