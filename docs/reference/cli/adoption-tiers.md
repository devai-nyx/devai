# Adoption tiers

An adoption tier is a repository's declared governance floor. It says which obligations are
binding now and which higher obligations are still observed as advisory. It is a staged adoption
contract, not an edition of DEVAI and not a switch that hides commands.

The complete tier population and per-tier semantics below are generated from the canonical
round-execution policy. Narrative on this page explains selection and climbing without maintaining
a second membership list.

## What a tier changes

For an obligation at or below the declared tier:

- the obligation is **binding**;
- its non-passing result participates in the command's aggregate according to the canonical
  verdict contract; and
- a missing, malformed, unknown, or skipped required result cannot be relabelled as pass.

For an obligation above the declared tier:

- it remains evaluated or reported when the applicable command supports that observation;
- it is marked **advisory** and excluded from the binding aggregate; and
- its diagnostic value remains available for planning the climb.

The constitution, role-by-path discipline, effect resolution, and explicit consent rules remain
binding at every tier. A lower tier never authorizes a forbidden write, makes a remote operation
local, turns missing evidence into pass, or enables autonomous execution.

## What a tier does not select

A tier is independent of the other selectors:

- a [check suite](./check-suites.md) chooses an ordered validation population;
- a [sense preset](./sense-presets.md) chooses an ordered observation population;
- a [sensor kind](./sensor-kinds.md) chooses one sensor contract;
- an [inventory slice](./inventory-slices.md) chooses one repository projection; and
- a [surface tier](./vocabulary.md#surface-tiers) controls whether a route appears in default or
  expanded help.

Declaring a tier therefore does not automatically run a similarly sized suite or preset. Select
each command population explicitly for the gate or observation you need.

## Declare an initial tier

Preview the target first. The plan reports the exact segmented projection and performs no write:

```sh
devai init plan --target . --tier tier1 --format json
```

Review that output, then apply only the role-owned segments you intend to create. The
[CLI overview](./index.md#typical-adoption-to-release-journey) shows the role-separated sequence.
After application, read the declared posture:

```sh
devai doctor --adopter --repo-root . --format json
```

Do not infer the effective tier from which commands happen to be installed or from a previous
run. The project declaration and the canonical policy are the inputs. If a declaration is absent,
the project-config schema defines the compatibility default; new adoption should declare the
intended tier explicitly instead of relying on that default.

## Read binding and advisory results

`doctor` reports the effective tier and every applicable diagnosis. A finding above the declared
floor stays in the report with advisory standing. A binding finding participates in `doctor.ok`;
an advisory finding does not, even though its own diagnostic result remains visible.

```sh
devai doctor --repo-root . --format json
```

For checks and sensors, read the member-level descriptor as well as the aggregate. A passing
binding aggregate does not mean that advisory observations passed, that higher-tier obligations
were satisfied, or that the repository is eligible for release.

## Climb to a higher tier

Climbing is explicit and monotonic:

1. Ask for the target-tier checklist. This branch is plan-only; do not add a role declaration or
   write consent:

   ```sh
   devai init upgrade --target . --tier tier2 --format json
   ```

2. Read every emitted step. Tier-checklist mode does not apply a mutation. Each step names an
   artifact, control, or observation that must be established before the target floor can honestly
   bind.
3. Complete changes through their owning roles and paths. The checklist does not widen a session's
   authority and does not execute those changes.
4. Update the repository's tier declaration through the authorized configuration transition.
5. Re-run `doctor` and the gate-required suite. The climb has standing only when the new binding
   population is actually evaluated; generating or completing a checklist is not itself a verdict.

If the requested target is not above the declared tier, the planner returns no climb steps. That
does not perform a downgrade. Unknown tiers, invalid configuration, unavailable prerequisites, or
failed binding checks remain explicit failures or diagnostics under their action contracts.

## Canonical tier descriptors

The renderer derives every stable identifier, label, exact obligation projection, prerequisite,
input/default, output/verdict behavior, effect/consent rule, cost class, use guidance, non-pass
semantics, example, source, and workflow link from
[`round-execution.json#/vocabularies/adoption_tiers`](../../../law/policy/round-execution.json) and
its declared supplemental sources.

### `tier1` — Tier1

- **Stable ID:** tier1
- **User-facing label:** Tier1
- **Purpose:** Select the canonical `tier1` adoption tier.
- **Population or projection:** `constitution-and-policy-pin`, `project-config`, `baseline-sensors`, `quick-check-suite`
- **Prerequisites:** A readable repository root and a canonical descriptor that resolves every selected member.
- **Required external tools:** Not applicable: no additional external tool is declared by the canonical adoption tier descriptor.
- **Accepted inputs:** `--tier tier1` and `--target <path>`.
- **Defaults:** Target `.`; the current declared adoption tier remains authoritative and no climb is inferred.
- **Output contract:** action-envelope using law/schemas/action-result.schema.json.
- **Verdict semantics:** `pass` requires the complete projection; unsupported or unresolved members return an error and never a partial pass.
- **Declared effect:** Not applicable: this vocabulary value grants no action effect.
- **Consent flags:** Not applicable: consent belongs to the enclosing action, not this vocabulary value.
- **Cost class:** `moderate`
- **When to use:** Use when the named adoption tier is the exact requested scope.
- **When not to use:** Do not treat it as a check suite, sense preset, or authority grant.
- **Non-pass semantics:** `fail` is a negative finding; `error` is an execution or producer defect; `unknown` never passes; `review` requires human disposition; `skipped` reports an unexecuted member; `N/A` is valid only when the governing contract explicitly permits it.
- **New-grammar example:** `devai init plan --tier tier1 --target . --format json`
- **Canonical source:** [`law/policy/round-execution.json`](../../../law/policy/round-execution.json#/vocabularies/adoption_tiers)

## Nonclaims

A tier declaration is not a readiness certificate. A `doctor` result describes its exact
repository and invocation; a suite or preset describes its exact population; release control has
its own separately authorized inputs and effects. Moving to a higher tier does not publish,
deploy, close a round, or promote evidence.

Canonical sources: [action registry](../../../law/policy/action-registry.json),
[round-execution policy](../../../law/policy/round-execution.json), and
[project-config schema](../../../law/schemas/project-config.schema.json).
