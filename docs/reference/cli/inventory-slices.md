# Select and render an inventory slice

An inventory slice is a deterministic projection of repository structure selected
through `devai sense inventory`. The generated reference below is rendered from the
canonical slice policy and the live inventory runtime descriptors; it is the lookup
authority for current contents, supported inputs, output bodies, limitations, effects,
costs, and examples. This page does not duplicate the mutable slice population.

## Inventory slices

<!-- devai:generated-entry category="inventory-slices" id="pack" -->

### `pack` — Pack

- **Stable ID:** pack
- **User-facing label:** Pack
- **Purpose:** Resolve the matching canonical stack-adapter pack.
- **Population or projection:** `stack-adapter-pack-resolution`. Supported stacks: Stacks represented by canonical pack detect rules; no hard-coded stack alias is inferred.
- **Prerequisites:** readable repository root; canonical pack registry and detect rules
- **Required external tools:** Not applicable: this slice declares no external tool.
- **Accepted inputs:** `--repo-root <path>`, `--adopter-root <path>`
- **Defaults:** repo root .; adopter root equals repo root
- **Output contract:** Action envelope containing {slice, members, status, results, implicit_persistence:false}; member bodies: `stack-adapter-pack-resolution` {matched, ambiguous, candidates, diagnostics} pack-resolution body.
- **Verdict semantics:** Only `pass` and `review` are emitted in a successful payload; process exit is pass or review respectively. Member rules: review when matched is null or resolution is ambiguous; otherwise pass. Exceptions exit fail.
- **Declared effect:** Not applicable to the vocabulary value; the enclosing canonical inventory action is read-only.
- **Consent flags:** No role, write, or publish consent is accepted or required by the read-only inventory action.
- **Cost class:** `moderate`
- **When to use:** Use for the exact deterministic `pack` repository projection.
- **When not to use:** Does not choose among ambiguous packs or invent support for an unmatched stack.
- **Non-pass semantics:** `review` is explicit and exits non-pass; implementation exceptions are `fail`. `unknown`, `skipped`, and `N/A` are not emitted by the current inventory payload.
- **New-grammar example:** `devai sense inventory --slice pack --repo-root . --adopter-root . --format json`

- **Verdict semantics:** Only `pass` and `review` are emitted in a successful payload; process exit is pass or review respectively. Member rules: review when orphan count is nonzero; otherwise pass. Exceptions exit fail.
- **Declared effect:** Not applicable to the vocabulary value; the enclosing canonical inventory action is read-only.
- **Consent flags:** No role, write, or publish consent is accepted or required by the read-only inventory action.
- **Cost class:** `moderate`

- **When not to use:** A missing trace file is an execution error; no empty trace is synthesized.

## Choose a slice

Pass exactly one `--slice <name>` from the generated reference. There is no implicit
slice default. Prefer the narrowest projection that answers the question; use the
aggregate slice only when you need its complete canonical member population and have
satisfied every member-specific input prerequisite.

For a read-only route projection of the current repository:

```sh
devai sense inventory --slice routes --repo-root . --format json
```

An unknown slice or unimplemented canonical member fails instead of silently returning
an empty or partial inventory.

## Inputs and defaults

`--repo-root` defaults to the current directory. Other inputs are slice-dependent and
are listed in each generated descriptor: adopter root for stack-pack resolution, trace
input for adherence, coverage JSON for coverage, and optional read-only database URL
and schema filtering for schema discovery. Paths are resolved against the repository
root. When the runtime declares a default path, absence of the required file is an
error or an explicit review result according to that member's contract; it is never an
invented empty success.

Inventory output is read-only and has no implicit persistence. Supplying a database URL
authorizes only the descriptor's read-only introspection path; it does not grant database
write authority. The command requires neither `--write` nor `--publish`.

## Results and exits

Machine output contains the selected slice identifier, its source-derived member order,
one result object per member, aggregate status, and `implicit_persistence: false`. A
member returns PASS or REVIEW with its typed projection. Any REVIEW makes the aggregate
REVIEW. PASS exits `0`, REVIEW exits `1`, and invalid input or execution failure exits
`2`.

The projections describe what the registered extractors can observe from their declared
inputs. Unsupported syntax, ambiguous stack matching, absent optional substrates, stale
coverage, or incomplete trace data must remain visible as a limitation, review, or error
as specified by the generated descriptor. The current inventory-slice aggregate does
not emit N/A or skipped results. Do not treat an inventory as a readiness, release, or
conformance verdict.

## Canonical descriptor

- [Round-execution policy](../../../law/policy/round-execution.json) — exact inventory
  slice identities, member populations, and order.
- [Inventory slice loader](../../../packages/sensors/src/inventory-slices.ts) — runtime
  consumption and fail-closed descriptor validation.
- [Inventory command runtime](../../../packages/cli/src/commands/sense/inventory.ts) —
  accepted inputs, defaults, projections, aggregate result, and errors.
- [Inventory action contract](../../../law/policy/action-registry.json) — public read
  route, authority, consent, and output envelope.
- [Documentation information architecture](../../../law/adr/ADR-023-r0007-documentation-information-architecture.md)
  — deterministic rendering and no-copy rule.

This is the R-0007 canonical operator handoff. It does not claim complete R-0009
narrative documentation, readiness, release, or deployment.
