# Authority and effects

DEVAI authorizes a non-read invocation only when two independent questions both resolve:

1. **Authority:** is the declared human role permitted to perform this action against these exact
   paths and resources?
2. **Effect:** what is the maximum intrinsic mutation the resolved invocation can perform, and did
   the caller supply the required consent?

A correct role cannot downgrade an effect. A declared effect cannot grant a role. Executor kind,
runtime, model, effort, skill, and capability cannot answer either question on their own.

## The authorization sequence

Before any mutation, the runtime:

1. resolves the exact leaf action and any parameterized member population;
2. derives the member population's capability ceiling and maximum effect;
3. resolves one human role declaration or one live, repository-bound authority session when the
   effect is non-read;
4. checks action, role, canonical target path, operation, and active policy together;
5. checks independent write and publication consent;
6. installs the exact planner and mutation-adapter boundary; and
7. re-verifies the final targets before committing the bounded effect.

Missing metadata, an unresolved target, effect/capability divergence, or policy disagreement fails
closed. A broad declaration is reviewable intent, not permission to perform an undeclared concrete
operation.

## Canonical role descriptors

The renderer derives the complete human-role population from the
[action-registry schema](../../../law/schemas/action-registry.schema.json) and joins it to
role/path rules in the [authority policy](../../../law/policy/authority-policy.json). The generated
entries own labels, exact projections, prerequisites, inputs/defaults, outputs, effects/consent,
cost, use guidance, non-pass behavior, examples, and source links.

The multi-role authority marker `joint` is composition metadata, not another human role. A task's
`discipline` supplies its role; an executor may not override it. Cross-role work requires a session
and commit boundary.

## Path authority

Role authority is positive and path-specific. The constitution and resolved authority policy own
the mapping. In practical terms:

- business reference work stays with its business authority;
- engineering law, governed round intent, and human documentation stay with engineering-reference
  authority;
- tests stay with sensor authority;
- plant code and workspace tooling stay with plant authority;
- audit observation stays in the designated audit output; and
- machine records and mutable harness state are written only through attributed verbs, never by a
  human role editing them directly.

This conceptual map is not an access-control list. Always use the exact
[authority policy](../../../law/policy/authority-policy.json) and action contract for the candidate.
An apparently adjacent directory, generated materialization, or host-tool file can have a different
owner or machine-only boundary.

## Canonical effect descriptors

The renderer derives the complete ordered effect population from the
[action-registry schema](../../../law/schemas/action-registry.schema.json) and joins each value to
per-action assignment in the [action registry](../../../law/policy/action-registry.json).

## Effect ceilings and exact resolution

An action registry entry declares a conservative capability ceiling. Build-time and contract-time
analysis must prove that inferred direct and transitive effects stay within it. At runtime, the
exact target and selected member population still have to resolve before authority.

That distinction matters for parameterized facades:

- `devai sense run <kind>` resolves the named kind's intrinsic effect before execution. The generic
  action ceiling does not force a read-only kind to request unrelated mutation authority, and it
  does not let a write-capable kind travel through a read boundary.
- `devai check --suite <name>` and `devai check --only <member>` resolve the maximum effect of the
  selected validation plan before execution.
- An action that emits a report can still be write-capable when its implementation mutates a
  database, workspace, remote, or harness state.

Inspect a parameterized population without running it:

```sh
devai sense run --preset sweep --round R-0007 --repo-root . --dry-run --format json
```

## Consent flags

Consent is invocation-scoped and independent:

- a non-read resolved effect requires explicit `--write`;
- every remote resolved effect additionally requires explicit `--publish`, including a dry run;
- `--publish` never implies `--write`;
- `--write` never implies `--publish`; and
- possession of a publication-capable action, role, model, adapter, or session does not satisfy
  either flag.

For a read-only action, a role declaration and write/publication consent are not applicable and
are refused rather than ignored. For a non-read action, provide exactly one `--as-role <role>` or
`--authority-session <id>`, not both. A caller cannot declare a machine actor.

A remote dry run performs no publication, but a selected sensor whose resolved effect is
`remote-write` still requires its permitted role and both independent consent flags,
`--write` and `--publish`.

## Safe examples

Read without a role declaration or consent:

```sh
devai release status --repo-root . --format json
devai evidence verify --scope chain --show-head --repo-root . --format json
```

Inspect a local-write leaf without dispatching it:

```sh
devai init apply architect --target . --tier tier1 --as-role architect --write --help
```

Perform that local write only after reviewing `init plan`:

```sh
devai init apply architect --target . --tier tier1 --as-role architect --write --format json
```

Inspect the remote-capable sensor action without dispatching it:

```sh
devai sense run --help
```

The last command is help-only. A selected sensor kind determines the actual effect and consent.

## Refusals and non-pass behavior

Authority is checked before handler dispatch. Typical refusals include a missing, conflicting,
invalid, expired, stale, repository-mismatched, or policy-mismatched declaration; a role not
allowed by the action; missing write or publication consent; unresolved target; unclassified
resource; or absent final mutation boundary.

These conditions produce one structured error envelope and no successful result envelope. Usage
and policy refusals do not become `review` or `unknown`; they prevent execution. Infrastructure and
contract violations use their own failure classes and cannot be treated as a completed action.

For an aggregate command, read the [verdict descriptor](./vocabulary.md#verdicts) after authority
succeeds. A permitted operation may still return review, unknown, fail, error, skipped, or N/A.
Authorization means only that the bounded attempt was allowed.

## Executor authority is forbidden

An executor says how to attempt a task. Its model capabilities may help select an eligible roster
entry, but they do not widen the task discipline, target paths, effects, or consent. Requested and
resolved execution evidence records the selection; it does not grant authority retroactively.

See [rounds, tasks, and executors](./round-task-executors.md#authority-stays-with-discipline) and
the generated [model/runtime reference](./model-runtime.md).

## Nonclaims

A policy allow proves only that one resolved invocation may attempt its bounded effects. It does
not prove the command's verdict, readiness, round closure, release eligibility, publication
success, deployment, or evidence promotion.
