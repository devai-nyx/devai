# DEVAI

DEVAI is a human-supervised control harness for AI-assisted software development.
It combines declared roles, bounded effects, repository sensors, validation, and
attributable evidence without replacing a project's build, test, or CI tools.

The v1.0 release-candidate product is one publishable package,
`@devai-nyx/cli`. Its current machine catalog contains **41 actions**, **59
sensors**, and **7 host-invoked recipes**. The ordinary public CLI is organized
into seven workflow domains: `init`, `doctor`, `check`, `sense`, `round`,
`evidence`, and `release`. `task` and `catalog` are internal plumbing exposed by
`--all` for maintainers and automation.

```bash
pnpm exec devai --help
pnpm exec devai catalog actions --format json
pnpm exec devai init plan --target . --tier tier1 --format json
pnpm exec devai doctor --repo-root . --format json
```

Mutating actions require their declared role and explicit consent. Read the plan
or dry-run output before granting `--write`; remote effects additionally require
their separately declared publication consent.

Tests use a content-addressed task DAG. During development, run affected nodes and
reuse fresh PASS results for unchanged inputs. Full coverage and the expensive
lanes are release-candidate gates. A signed candidate receipt binds a clean Git
tree and task-policy digest to trusted local attestations; it does **not** prove
that the signer actually executed the tasks. Remote CI validates that binding and
the required-node closure cheaply.

Human maintainers choose scope, review changes, and authorize releases. No command
or evidence record substitutes for that decision.
